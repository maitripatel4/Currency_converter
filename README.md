CURRENCY CONVERTOR
for Northern Trust (APAC TECH HACKATHON - Team 2)

We have built the web page using streamlit library.

The exchange rate for the conversion will be taken from the csv files for 11 years (2011-2022).
We have combined all the csv files for 11 years into one single csv file "Currency_Data_All_Years.csv".

Functional tasks implemented:
- We find the exchange rate for the given date and input currency
- Conversion of currency for the given amount of money
- Plotting of the graph according to the trend(weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly) as entered by the user

- The line graph will be displayed along with the minimum and maximum values corresponding to the given input parameters

We have uploaded the following files:
- A combined csv file "Currency_Data_All_Years.csv"
- A python file in which the code is written "app.py"
- Individual csv files for 11 years
- A text file explaning the system prerequisites along with steps to host the webpage "REQUIREMENTS.md"


We take three inputs:
1. Currency-1 to be converted
2. The converted currency value which we want.
3. The date for which the conversion will happen.


How to use:
1. Select the currency you want to convert
2. Select the second currency
3. Enter the date for which you would want to use the exchange rate
4. You could also convert a certain amount of money into that currency value
5. Select the trend for which you would want to see the plotation, this would also have the minimum and maximum values for that particular trend.
